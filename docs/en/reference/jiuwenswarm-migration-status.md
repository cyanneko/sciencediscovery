# JiuwenSwarm migration: status and hand-over

Where issue 84 (reuse the JiuwenSwarm backend) stands, what runs today, what does not, and how to start
working on a sub-issue. To run it, see [Run agent turns on JiuwenSwarm](../how-to/run-with-jiuwenswarm.md).

## What this baseline is

A **transitional architecture**, chosen deliberately: the existing TypeScript API keeps owning storage
(sessions, messages, run events, permission records) and every route the UI calls. Only the **agent
executor** is replaced: the model loop runs on JiuwenSwarm 0.2.6, reached through a Python **adapter**
that also sits in front of the API as a reverse proxy.

```text
browser ─▶ adapter :4310 ──proxy──▶ legacy API :4410 ──createAgent──┐
              │  ▲                                                   │ POST /agent/runs
              │  └────── tool calls (loopback bridge, per run) ◀─────┤
              ▼
        JiuwenSwarm gateway ─▶ model, through /llm/<token>/v1 (adapter)
              └── MCP tools ─▶ /mcp/<token> (adapter, forwards to the bridge)
```

This is **not** the end state written in the issue body (routes served by the adapter on top of
JiuwenSwarm's own storage). Each sub-issue below says how much of its end state is still open. Whether the
acceptance criteria that assume the end state should be rewritten for this architecture is an open
decision for the issue owners.

Design and measured protocol facts: [`services/adapter/README.md`](../../../services/adapter/README.md).

## Status by sub-issue

| Issue | State | What exists | What does not |
|---|---|---|---|
| 86 Acceptance baseline, protocol calibration | closed | Interface inventory (259 rows), L1/L2 tooling, 27 recorded cases on Linux, protocol experiments, `CI_E2E_BACKEND=jiuwenswarm` | Cases for 104 rows; the 59 "approximate" mappings were not calibrated; `AgentRuntime` not evaluated |
| 87 Adapter core | closed | Public port, streaming proxy (SSE, NDJSON), 502 on upstream failure, optional token on `/agent/*` | Own storage, run registry, event log and resume: they stay in the legacy API |
| 88 Sessions and projects | closed | Served by the legacy API through the proxy; L1 covers all 13 rows | Nothing moves to JiuwenSwarm's session store |
| 89 Chat and runs | closed | A run executes on JiuwenSwarm; events, cancel, approval, usage, disconnect handling; L2 golden traces for 8 scenarios | See "Known gaps" |
| 90 Permissions | closed | Approval requests, allow/deny, grants, audit, epoch and wrong-token refusal behave as before (L1 8/8 plus negative cases, L2 approve/deny) | Not mapped to JiuwenSwarm's permission engine (left off; the API's permission runtime decides). Finding below |
| 91 Models, providers, settings | closed | Model list, defaults and settings served by legacy (L1 covers every row); the selected model is handed to JiuwenSwarm per run | All three model protocols run, through the API's loopback model gateway |
| 92 MCP and data sources | closed | All 21 rows have L1 cases; the five MCP journeys pass on this executor (custom MCP, agent calls a custom MCP tool, OAuth, secret edit x2); deferred MCP tools are promoted up front and `tool_search` is offered | MCP OAuth against a real provider was not exercised |
| 93 Skills and libraries | open | Served by legacy | 0/35 L1 cases; skill use on this executor is not verified |
| 94 Files, workspace, trajectory | open | Read routes have L1 cases | Trajectory view is empty for JiuwenSwarm runs (no `evidence` recorded) |
| 95 Planning and sub-agents | closed | `update_plan` and `task` run through the bridge; L1 covers every row; L2 subagent and two-turn cases match; M0 plan and delegate journeys pass; a resumed subagent gets its history | JiuwenSwarm's own todo/subagent/agent-template features are not used (subagents are the API's `task` tool) |
| 97 Science toolset as MCP | closed | The equivalent toolset is offered as MCP tools that call the legacy tools over the bridge, through the same ToolRegistry; a test pins the offered set and schemas to the registry's; deferred tools are promoted up front with `tool_search` offered; parallel calls run and match | Tools of later sub-issues (idea-tree, evolve, memory, artifact review) arrive with those |
| 103 Usage | closed | Per-model-call token counts become `model.usage` and are summed; session usage and per-model usage after a run match the built-in loop (L2); every row has an L1 case | Nothing moves to adapter storage; analytics stay in the API |
| 93, 94, 96, 98-102, 104-106 | open | Unchanged legacy behaviour behind the proxy | Everything: not started as migrations. Runner/environment/remote-host reads have L1 cases |

## Verified

On the Aliyun Linux server (bubblewrap sandbox) with `SCIENCE_AGENT_ADAPTER=1 SCIENCE_AGENT_EXECUTOR=jiuwenswarm`:

- The five milestone-0 journeys (first run, compact process ×2, plan workspace, delegate subtask, deliver result) pass.
- One journey against a live OpenAI-compatible model passes (`journey-real-request`).
- L2: 10 run-event scenarios (text, tool call, approve/deny, cancel, 401, subagent, resume, post-messages, two-turn conversation, parallel tool calls) have the same event-type sequence as the built-in loop. Accepted differences are in
  `test/st/contract/accepted-differences.json` (the wording of a provider 401, and the evidence gap).
- L1: the recorded cases match between the built-in loop and the adapter + JiuwenSwarm stack, apart from build version strings, which are scrubbed.
- Unit tests: adapter (`pytest`, 135) and the TypeScript agent factory and model gateway (51). `test/st/contract/jw-only/live.mjs` checks against a running JiuwenSwarm stack what only this backend does (conversation continuity, todo planning).

## Context management

JiuwenSwarm has a context engine of its own (it compresses at 80% of the model's window and injects its own per-step dynamic context). The executor now uses it:

| | Built-in loop | JiuwenSwarm executor |
|---|---|---|
| Where the conversation lives | The API's record, re-sent every step | JiuwenSwarm's session, one per agent (persisted in its checkpoint database); nothing is sent along and the adapter holds none |
| Compression when the window fills | ScienceDiscovery's own compactor | JiuwenSwarm's (the model's real window is passed on; **behaviour on a full window not verified**) |
| System prompt sections (identity, governance, capabilities, skills) | Assembled per step | Same text, composed once per run |
| Run contract, protected | Every step | **Not injected** |
| Plan snapshot, durable state, plugin context | Every step | **Not injected**; JiuwenSwarm adds its own dynamic context |
| Tool routing hints | Yes | **Not injected** |
| Tool-output guard and reader | Yes | Yes (same `ToolRegistry`) |
| Recovery from an input-too-large error | Compact and retry | JiuwenSwarm's own handling; **not verified** |
| Trajectory and evidence | Yes | **None** |

## Known gaps

1. **No evidence or trajectory.** Runs on JiuwenSwarm produce no `agent.record`/`evidence` events, so the trajectory view is empty.
2. **History and context.** JiuwenSwarm is the only holder of the model's context: a stable session per agent, compressed by JiuwenSwarm; the adapter and the API send and rebuild nothing. So a session begun on the built-in loop is not remembered by JiuwenSwarm (its earlier turns are on screen only), and a conversation edited or rewound in the API is not reflected there. That context survives a restart of JiuwenSwarm (checked: `live.mjs history-restart`). The run contract and the per-step dynamic context (plan snapshot, durable state) are not injected: see "Context management".
3. **Model protocols:** all three the UI can configure work (a loopback gateway in the API serves JiuwenSwarm's chat-completions requests through the native model client). Images are not sent to the model.
4. **No tool-output store** in the JiuwenSwarm toolset. Deferred tools are promoted up front. Tool calls of one model response are scheduled by the native rules (a tool not declared concurrency-safe runs alone, in the order the model called it; duplicate calls are superseded by batch policies), so both executors produce the same events in the same order.
5. **Wake notices.** The mocked E2E `issue-77-wake-notice` fails on this executor (the scripted model recognises the wake turn by a prompt JiuwenSwarm does not present that way). `issue-85` passes. Run the group with `CI_E2E_BACKEND=jiuwenswarm .ci/run-e2e.sh mocked`. The journeys are load-sensitive on a small host: two of them failed once when run back to back on the 2-core server and passed alone (three repeats), so run them one at a time when in doubt.
6. **Legacy bugs found while recording (not fixed):** `PUT /api/sessions/:id/settings` with a bad body returns 500; `PUT /api/web/settings` with its own GET body returns 500; skill evolution on an unknown run returns 500; reading a file outside the workspace (`/file?path=../../etc/passwd`) returns 500 instead of 4xx.
7. **Finding for #90:** after `POST /api/sessions/:id/permission-epoch`, a session-scoped grant still applies (the epoch concerns the sandbox, the grant the session). The issue text expects old authorizations to become invalid; the baseline records what legacy does.

## Start working on a sub-issue

1. Choose the backend and start the stack: `scripts/jiuwenswarm.sh setup` once, then `./scripts/start-stack.sh --mode local --jiuwenswarm` (check with `GET /agent/info`); see the [how-to](../how-to/run-with-jiuwenswarm.md).
2. Find your routes in `test/st/contract/routes.json` (`node test/support/contract/run.mjs --coverage` lists the rows without a case).
3. Add a case under `test/st/contract/cases/`, record it on a **fresh data directory** against the built-in loop, compare it against the adapter + JiuwenSwarm stack. Rules, the SSE step form and normalization: [`test/st/contract/README.md`](../../../test/st/contract/README.md). Baselines are read-only for agents; a change needs human review.
4. For behaviour, use the run-event cases (`l2-runs.json`); the stub model is `test/support/contract/stub-model.mjs`.
5. Browser journeys: `CI_E2E_BACKEND=jiuwenswarm .ci/run-e2e.sh mocked` (gateway must be running).
